# Global Game Jam 2018 - at the University of Miami

Global Game JamÂ® 2018 is a non-profit volunteer-run event with a single goal: to bring together people all over the world to have a great time making innovative games.

These wonderful and generous volunteers give thousands of hours of their time every year because they believe in the spirit of GGJ. This team relies on all of our jammers to operate within that spirit to achieve the same goal. Global Game Jam is not a competition; it's a worldwide creative collaboration.
